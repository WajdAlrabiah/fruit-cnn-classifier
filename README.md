# Fruit CNN Classifier 🍉🥝

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project that classifies images of fruits (mango and kiwi) using TensorFlow and Keras. This project demonstrates image preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction with a simple CNN architecture.

---

## Features

- Load and preprocess fruit images from dataset.
- Resize images to 128x128 pixels and normalize input data.
- Split dataset into training and testing sets.
- Build a CNN model with multiple convolutional, batch normalization, pooling, and dropout layers.
- Train the model and visualize accuracy and loss.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Predict class of new fruit images.

## Dataset

The project uses a fruits dataset containing images of mango and kiwi:

- `mango fruit/*` → Label 0
- `kiwi fruit/*` → Label 1

## Hello and Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
